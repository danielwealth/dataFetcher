# dataFetcher
 We create a `App` component that fetches data from the JSONPlaceholder API using Axios.
- We use the `useState` hook to store the fetched data in the component's state.
- We use the `useEffect` hook to fetch data when the component mounts.
- We handle loading states and errors by rendering a loading message or an error message.
- We create a reusable `List` component that takes an array of items as props and renders each item dynamically.
- We use the `map` method to iterate over the items and render a list item for each one.
